## Current State

**You can use Hokus for some workflows right now**. It is fully ready to manage local Hugo websites.

Start today, [download our installer (Windows or Linux)](https://github.com/julianoappelklein/hokus/releases), install Hokus on your PC and set up a website within seconds by using our wizard.

Just keep in mind that **Hokus will be much more** in the future.

## Getting Started

* [Download](https://github.com/julianoappelklein/hokus/releases) and install. 
* Open the application.
* In the home screen, add a new website and choose a Site Source _(at the moment, the only option is the Folder Source)_ and complete the form.
* A default configuration file (hokus.yaml) will be placed at the root of your website. After this, open your website workspace and try to create a post.
* Tweak the configuration file to suit your needs. You can create multiple collections and singles and set many build and serve configurations.

## Basics

You'll have to learn some concepts before diving deep into Hokus. But don't worry, they are very easy to master.

### Website Configuration File

The website configuration files are stored in your *home/username/Hokus* folder.
You can have multiple websites, each having their own configuration file. _\(e.g. config.website-1.json, config.website-2.json\)_

A minimal website configuration file looks like this:

```
{   
  "name": "Hokus Website", /* your website friendly name */
  "key": "hokus-website", /* your website unique key */
  "source": { /* where your website workspaces will come from */
    "type": "folder", /* every source has a type but for now we only have the folder type */
    "path": "D:/Projects/hokus-website/" /* an absolute path to your website folder */
  },
  "publish": [ /* configurations used to server your workspaces to use with Hugo executable */
    {
      "key": "default",
      "config": {
        "type": "folder",
        "path": "D:\\website-output-path\\"
      }
    }
  ]       
}
```

Note that your website configuration can be a JSON, YAML or TOML file.

### Workspace Configuration File

All the UI configurations and bindings are set in the workspace configuration file.

* The workspace configuration file must be placed at the root of your Hugo website.
* It should be versioned under the same _version control system_ as your website.

For a minimal configuration file, see the default workspace configuration (which is auto created when you open a workspace without configuration), slightly changed:

```
{
  "hugover": "0.35",
  "serve":[
    "key":"default",
    "config":"config.toml"
  ],
  "build":[
    "key":"default",
    "config":"config.toml"
  ],
  "collections":[
    {
      "key": "posts", /* a unique key */
      "title": "Posts", /* a friendly title for your menu item */
      "folder": "content/posts/", /* relative path to a list of page bundles */
      "extension": "md", /* md|html|json|toml|yaml */
      "dataformat": "yaml", /* yaml|json|toml */
      "itemtitle": "Post", /* a title for a single item of the collection */
      "fields": /* here you will set up your UI binded to the collection */
      [
        { "type":"info", "content":"# Info\nYou can write custom instructions here." },
        { "key":"title", "title":"Title", "type":"string" },
        { "key":"mainContent", "title":"Content", "type":"markdown" },
        { "key":"pubdate", "title":"Pub Date", "type":"date" },
        { "key":"draft", "title":"Draft", "type":"boolean" },
        { "key":"bundle-manager", "type":"bundle-manager", "resourcetype":"img", "path":"imgs", "extensions: ["png","jpg","gif"], "fields":[
            { "key":"title", "title":"Title", "type":"string" },
            { "key":"description", "title":"Description", "type":"string", "multiLine":true }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "singles":[
    {
      "key": "mainConfig", /* a unique key */
      "title": "Main Config", /* a friendly title for your menu item */
      "file": "config.yaml", /* a relative path to your file. "somePath/yourfilename.(md|html|json|toml|yaml)" */
      "fields":[
        { "key":"title", "title":"Site Title", "type":"string" }
        { "key":"params", "title":"Params", "type":"nest", fields: [
          //... more fields
        ]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that your workspace configuration can be a JSON, YAML or TOML file.

### Fields

Collections and singles configurations have a property named "fields" where you must provide an array of field configurations.

Each field must use one of the available Hokus components by setting a "type" property. The current types list is below:

* accordion
* boolean
* bundle-manager
* chips
* code-editor
* date
* leaf-array
* hidden
* markdown
* nest
* number
* readonly
* section
* select
* string

Some components have a "field" or "fields" property, allowing for nesting and composition.

To see the components in action, you can access our [Forms Cookbook](http://formscookbook.hokus.io.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). For quick reference. _\(the Forms Cookbook is also included in the desktop app.\)_

You can also refer to the source code to see all available properties for each component type.

### More Concepts

More concepts are yet to come, but with those already given, and by looking into the Forms Cookbook, you should now be ready to use Hokus CMS.

## Building

###  Building on Windows

* Install the required tools:
  * [Git (optional)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * [Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * [Visual Studio 2017 (c++ tools)](//docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/visualstudio/)
* Clone or download the source code.
* Open the terminal in the project's root directory.
* Run ```npm install --only=dev & npm run _rebuild-native & npm run dist-win```

###  Building on Linux


Install the required tools:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install git-core
```

Clone the repository and set the current directory to the root:

```git clone https://github.com/julianoappelklein/hokus.git & cd hokus```

Install NPM dependencies and build:

```npm install --only=dev & npm run _rebuild-native & npm run dist-linux```

### Building on macOS

We are looking for candidates to help with that.

## Help Wanted

Right now, Hokus is almost a one-man project. When I (Juliano Appel Klein) started to develop it, I was trying to create a simple tool to let customers edit their Hugo websites. But soon I figured out this was not a simple task.

I believe Hokus can become a great project. The Hugo community is large and there is a lack os simple tools to use.

If you want to contribute, please let me know. You can [create an issue](https://github.com/julianoappelklein/hokus/issues) or reach me through the website [contact page](https://www.hokus.io/contact/).

## Vision

The desired workflow for Hokus is:

* Someone installs Hokus and opens it.
* A list of existent Hugo website templates ("Hokus-ready") are listed for selection.
* The user select the desired template and the website is downloaded.
* Right from the start, the user can create posts without hassle.
* The user selects a way to version the content and a place to publish it, just providing minimal configurations.

## Development Stack

* Node JS
* Electron
* React (using create-react-app)
* Material UI for React JS
* Flow
